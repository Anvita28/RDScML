# Project 2: COVID-19 Visualisation

## Overview
With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a tool is essential to track Corona Spread across the world. With so many tools already available, how will this analysis be unique? This visualiser will have additional comparison features to gain insights in the spread. Interactive geospatial maps and possible analysis of other relative features like GDP of countries, and other socio economic factors.

## Goals
- Building a data science visualisation app using StreamLit to visualise the live COVID-19 Spread.
- Try comparing it with socio economic factors to gain insights about any patterns between the spread and their economic status.
