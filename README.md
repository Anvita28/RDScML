# Roadmap to Data Science and Machine Learning (RDScML)
Built as a guide for anyone who is new to data science and machine learning; it provides a detailed guide, that is- from everything about Python, NumPy, Pandas, word2vec, NLTK etc to using these APIs to build projects and build solution to business problems.

## Contribution Guidelines
#### Working on an issue:
1. `git pull upstream master`
2. `git branch <name_of_the_branch>` OR `git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`
3. Create a titled .ipynb file which contains the details as explained by the issue or make the changes that you want.
4. `git status`
5. `git add <file_name>`, stage only those files that you want to commit.
6. `git commit -m "<commit_message>"`, eg: git commit -m "solves issue 2" or git commit -m "adds notebook"
7. `git push`

#### Creating a pull request:
- Specify the issue number that the pull request is fixing in the description section:
`Fixes: #<issue_number>`
- Give a suitable title to the pull request.
- Also, add a few statements explaining what the pull request is about.
